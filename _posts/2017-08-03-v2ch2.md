> The Investigation Case Building Continues.

We will have the trial on 8-5. Propose 2pm meetup for quick lunch and start 2:30. Should be a 4 hr session.

- Note those of you who participate in CH1 will have a 1.5 via private email discussion. Be on the lookout!


I strongly encourage viewing this: GREATPC: What's your job as a Player Character in Roleplaying?
It may make the difference for the next session
