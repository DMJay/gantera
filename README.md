# Gantera

A website for a fantasy game set in the world of Gantera

[**LINK**](https://akshmakov.github.io/gantera)


This README is primarily for information on contributing for session players and DM.



# Organization


Pages are organized in four categories

- `post` DM Blog post (session information, updates, etc)
- `journal` Player Journal
- `world` World Information, places, maps, history
- `characters` Player and NPC character sheets


Contributing to any category is as easy as creating a new **markdown** file under the appropriate folder. An entry is automatically added to the front page for that category.



## Writing a new journal entry or post

The steps to create a new DM or Player post is simple

1. Create a file under `_posts/` or `_journal/` folder
  - File must start with date and title  with extension `.md` `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`
  - e.g. `2017-08-06-session10.md`

2. The top of the file needs to contain some meta information with the title
```
---
title: Session 10 - intrigue
---
DOCUMENT GOES HERE
```
3. Create your post using markdown files, for attaching images see below
  - Use the github preview window to see your post rendered
  - There are thousands of markdown tutorials on the web
  - Basic formatting syntax is basically the same used on web forums, reddit, etc.



## Writing a new character or world information page

The process is the same as creating a new blog post, but pages must be made under the folder `_world` or `_chars` as appropriate.

There is no need to include the date in the title, any file name with `.md` extension will do
